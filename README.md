How long you spent on the assignment.
I spent around 4-5 hours on the assignment

What you like about your implementation.
The timeline is clean and easy to read. The text doesnâ€™t go out of bounds. Divided the timeline into components and not just written in a single file of code.

What you would change if you were going to do it again.
Make the timeline slightly smaller so more of it can be viewed by default. Right now it is fairly zoomed in. Also having different events on the same day be joined to each other.

How you made your design decisions. For example, if you looked at other timelines for inspiration, please note that.
For visual design (CSS section) I looked at - some of the basic timelines others had done on YouTube.

How you would test this if you had more time.
Passing mock data to see whether or not certain dates would work correctly, like having all dates be the same. I would also test layout on different screen sizes. Also implement some of the optional functions in the instructions.
